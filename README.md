# HexAI-TJAtxt
## A Textual Dataset to Advance Open Scientific Research in Total Joint Arthroplasty  
<p align="justify">Total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is the most common and fastest inpatient surgical procedure in the elderly, nationwide. With the growing number of TJA patients and advances being made in healthcare settings, an increasing number of scientific articles are now published in a daily basis, representing invaluable information in TJA, ranging from TJA diagnosis, prevention, and treatment strategies to genetic variants and epidemiological factors. However, little is done to computationally assemble a large-scale textual dataset from scientific articles, and make it publicly available for open scientific research in TJA. Rapid yet computational text analytics on such a large-scale scientific literature has a great potential to discover novel knowledge in better understanding joint diseases, improving the quality of care and clinical outcomes for TJA. The current dataset entitled HexAI-TJAtxt includes more than 69,000 scientific abstracts collected from PubMed using MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms within "MeSH Subheading" and "MeSH Major Topic", and Publication Date from 01/01/2000 to 12/31/2022. The current dataset is freely and publicly available at [here](https://github.com/pitthexai/HexAI-TJAtxt), and it will be updated frequently in bi-monthly manner from new abstracts published at PubMed.  </p>

### Value of the Data
+ <p align="justify">The <strong>MCIndoor20000</strong> dataset collected in <strong>Marshfield Clinic</strong> (https://www.marshfieldclinic.org/), and it presents various digital images of three guideline indoor objects, including clinic signs, doors and stairs.</p>
+ <p align="justify">Computational vision have become ubiquitous in our daily life, with a variety of applications ranging from face recognition and fingerspelling to surveillance systems and healthcare informatics. Core to many of these applications is image classification and recognition which is defined as an automatic task that assigns a label from a fixed set of categories to an input image. The <strong>MCIndoor20000</strong> dataset is a resource for use by the computer vision and deep learning community, and it boosts image classification research. </p>
+ <p align="justify">To provide a comprehensive image classification repository, the current dataset covers several object model variations involved from the perspectives of computer vision and deep learning strategies. The variations include viewpoint variation, intra-class variation, rotation, noisy conditions (e.g., Gaussian, Poisson), and occlusion. </p>
+ <p align="justify">The <strong>MCIndoor20000</strong> dataset assists reproducible research and allows rapid application development (RAD) and fast prototyping to the deep learning and computer vision community. </p>
